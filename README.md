# PHP WebSocket
## Simple WebSocket server for PHP

Version: **1.0.0**

The latest version of this project has been renamed Wrench. Development
continues at [varspool/Wrench](https://github.com/varspool/Wrench), where the
master represents a refactored and much nicer library.

This repository exists so that anyone with submodules or dependencies set up
can update their remote definitions.

 - https://github.com/varspool/Wrench.git
 - git://github.com/varspool/Wrench.git

Be sure to change your branch from master to 1.0.0 if you want this exact
version of the library. Or, stick with master to get the lastest updates of the
new version.
